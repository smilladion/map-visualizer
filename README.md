# Map Visualizer for Desktop

A parser and desktop visualization tool for the OpenStreetMap XML format, leveraging Java and the JavaFX platform. Makes use of efficient algorithms for pathfinding (Dijkstra's algorithm) and memory management (k-d tree). The application has several interface features within navigation, searching, and route planning. Map elements are filtered out based on zoom level while the k-d tree data structure ensures elements are dynamically removed when outside the screen borders.
